# Quantum state tomography with gradient descent 

This repository fork  the GD_QST(https://github.com/mstorresh/GD-QST).

## Installation and use

the myenvironment.yml has been much simplified.

```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate applesilicon_gd_qst_env
```
The notebooks in the `examples` folder are tutorials on how to do the quantum state tomography with the different methods of gradient descent. 

The `data_and_paper-plots` folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that runs the methods used to generate the plots presented in the paper, along with a ZIP file containing the corresponding data.
